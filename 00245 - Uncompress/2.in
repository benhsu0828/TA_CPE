Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there lived a king.
The king had a daughter. The daughter loved stories, and 2 would often ask her father to tell 2.
Every night, the king would sit beside his daughter and tell her a story.
Sometimes 4 was a fairy tale, sometimes 4 was a story about 9 2 6 7 5.
"Please," she would say, "tell me the one about the brave knight again!"
So 2 told 2 the story again. And again. And 3 still loved it.
Over time, the story became part of their tradition. 7 would 6 9 2 before bed, without fail.
