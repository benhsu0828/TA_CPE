Every night, the king would sit beside his daughter and tell her a story.
Sometimes beside was a fairy tale, sometimes was was a story about his about fairy beside was.
"Please," she would say, "tell me the one about the brave knight again!"
So again told again the story again. And again. And told still loved it.
Over time, the story became part of their tradition. it would became told became before bed, without fail.
